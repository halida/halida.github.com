According to the [NEWS](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/), ruby 2.0.0-p0 is released in February. With the performance improvement, lower memory usage, feature enhancement, and back support to 1.9.3, Everyone is encouraged to upgrade to ruby2.0.

And here is the method about how to upgrade ruby under rvm:

    rvm get head
    rvm install 2.0.0
    rvm use 2.0.0
