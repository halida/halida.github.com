As a blogger for many years, creating new blog post is harder and harder for me.

So why it is harder? Because I consider quality of blog post more now.

To have a high quality blog post, it should have:

- **High information density**. It should focus on one topic, with enough supportive information.
- **Depth**. It should walk through the topic, view all the angles, dig deep into the essence, so reader can have a clear view.
- **New content**. We should not discuss something already done.
- **Something inspiring**. It can create spark which can enlighten reader's mind.

World is filled with noise, and readers face more danger on the thing 
which I call *information sugar*: it has some value, but the time spending on reading, is more valuable than the value it contains.
SNS and news sites filled with it, sweat to read, and lots of time wasted without notice.

Creating high quality information need lots of time, focus, hard working, and care.
I hope I can provide more of it, other than the sweet *information sugar*.
