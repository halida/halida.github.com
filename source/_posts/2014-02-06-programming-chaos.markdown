Programming, as a career, face more chaos compare to other professionals.

First, everyone can start programming after several months of study,
it makes programmers are group of people vary in coding abilities, basic understanding of computer science,
and engineer training.

Programming as a professional, start only decades ago,
principle for this domain, like technology, tools, best practice, are still under developing.

And IT industry always changes dramatically,
that makes programming career path is not as clear as other professionals,
many job position, like big data analyst, not even exists several years ago.

The chaos brings both risk and opportunity, make programming career both interesting and challenging.
