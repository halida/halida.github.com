This is the first time I'm blogging in English here, 
And from now on, I will keep on doing it regularly.

Why Blogging?
------------------------------

I'm blogging for good reason. As a blogger, I'm not elegant or productive, or even continuous,
I had drop blogging for quite a long time; Hopefully I struggle to bring all things together again.
Blogging is not easy as it starts, it needs patience, persistence, continuous self-improvement.
And it worth that, I told you reasons.

Blogging is a process to help you **organize thoughts**. Things are not as clear as you think it is, before you write it down.

Blogging is **practice of writing**, there is no need to emphasize the importance of writing.

Blogging is a **good communication**, small talks are good, but too small for serious discussion, and hard to summon all things up.

Blogging is **self advertising**. There is no better way to know a person's mind than seeing things written by him, and writing itself can reflect lots of great attributes.

Why English Blogging?
------------------------------

And there comes another question: Why I start English blogging? here are some reasons:

English is **THE** universal language, practice it, is a good investment.

The people using English is **better** than The people using Chinese (statistically).

The thinking process is very **different** between English and Chinese. It brings me an opportunity of switching.

Conclusion
------------------------------

According to the reason I list above and the condition I'm currently in, English blogging is profitable.
Maybe it is also a good option for you.
