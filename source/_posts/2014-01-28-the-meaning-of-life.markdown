At some point in the life, we may ask ourselves: **What's the meaning of life?**
We seek answers from others, from social groups or religion groups, from books written by philosophers.

In the ancient times, philosophers ask bigger question: **What is the meaning of humanity?**
Someone turns to the obvious answer: **there must be the god, and god creates human for good.**
The question turns into: **what god wants?** Argument of it was through the history, and bring conflict and war.

Someone asks another question: **If there is god, where is the god?**
They start to seek the proof, develop system of critical thinking, then the light of rationality shining, expulse the shadow of mysticism.
And we got science, and we can identify facts, and we found the big discovery of evolution, with the proof of it.
It turns out either there is no god, or the god is not concern about us,
human is a kind of random generated chemical compound which can reproduce itself,
specialized in alter environment with the help of a highly developed organ called brain random generated thousands of thousands years ago.

The big answer of human meanin is unveiled now, If human as a group has no meaning, what about each individual?
Maybe no default meaning, we still can **seek it ourselves**. Without meaning, life is no more than an ordinary animal.
With meaning, life of roaming turns into life of journey with porpose, great things can be done, ordinary can be extraordinary,
and life can be meanful.
